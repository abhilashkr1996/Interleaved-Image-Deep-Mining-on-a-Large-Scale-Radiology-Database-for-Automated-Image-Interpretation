# Research-paper-Slides-Summary

Here is the slides for the recent research paper 'Interleaved Text/Image Deep Mining on a Large-Scale Radiology Database for Automated Image Interpretation'.
I have also put the research paper and other required papers for the support.
This paper is mainly on how to apply machine learning or in particular deep learning on large-scale medical databases.
A very good paper for knowledge and learning .
